# OpenCV ML Rs Bot
 
This project was used to learn about OpenCV and utilize some machine learning techniques to detect objects in the popular game, RuneScape. 

This demo was performed on a non-licensed private server.

Program is able to detect Abyssal Demons using an ML model that was trained using HAAR. The .xml, along with training vectors, are included in this repo. 
It can also detect prayer level using template matching, as well as locating and interacting with prayer potions using the same technique. 

I do not condone the use of cheating software that may negatively impact other players or the game's integrity.
